My github link for part C: https://github.com/quentinchen727/hw2_partC.git

1. Command to configure the remote:
git remote add origin  https://github.com/quentinchen727/hw2_partC.git          
If it is git cloned from remote, the output of git remote -v will be:
remote/origin   https://github.com/quentinchen727/hw2_partC.git (fetch) 
remote/origin   https://github.com/quentinchen727/hw2_partC.git (push) 

2. After running git fetch origin, there is nothing in the local working diretory, because anything from remote is not merged automatically.
git merge origin/master master // to merge the latest change from remote.

Run "git branch -a -r" to show all the branches.
What is a bare repository?
A bare repository is repo created with "git init --bare". They are stuctured a bit differently form working directories. First, they contain no source files. Second, it stores git revision history of your repo in the root folder of your repo instead of in a .git subfolder. It is mainly used for sharing.

Briefly discuss remote-tracking branches and their relevance.
Remote branchname keeps a copy of the corresponding remote branches. If there is any conflict between remote branches and local branches, the remote tracking branch provides a flexible option to check the diff between remote and local, then base on the result, you can make an more informed decision compared to blindly git pull.

Push change on another branch:
git push  -u remote_name local_branch //This will create a corresponding remote branch.
